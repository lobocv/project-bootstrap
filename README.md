# project-bootstrap

This is a bootstrapping template for starting projects.

It helps you quickly:

    - Build a containerized development environment (via docker)
    - Start containerized dependencies (via docker compose)
    - Build a customized shell (devshell)


This repo shows an example for a golang project but can easily be switched to any language / stack.
